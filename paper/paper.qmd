Notice that marriages in Toronto went down but they seem to be rising again @fig. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-plots
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("../data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv")
data |>
  ggplot(
    aes(x = year, y = marriage_licenses)
  ) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = 'pink') +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    title = "Marriages in Toronto from 2016 - 2013",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Marriage Licenses"
  )
```
